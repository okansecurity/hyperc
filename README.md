# HYPERC 

This project is an experimental endeavor I started with the goal of **extending the C language and adapting it to my own needs**.  
As a developer with ADHD, I apply my own methods to make the coding process fun and fluid.

The name HyperC is inspired by ADHD, specifically the hyperactivity aspect.

## Project Goals

As the project progresses, I plan to add:

- **Array Management:** Dynamic arrays and resizing operations.  
- **Memory Management:** Safe and efficient memory handling using `malloc`, `realloc`, `free`, etc.  
- **Error Handling:** Catching program errors and responding appropriately.  
- **Logging System:** Tracking program execution and recording errors and actions.  
- **Error Control Systems:** Security and validation mechanisms against unexpected situations.  
- **Object-Like Structures:** Structures that mimic class/object behavior in C for modular coding.

This project is a **personal, experimental effort to develop C according to my own needs**.  
My aim is to go beyond classic C and build a **more flexible, user-focused foundation**.  

> âš¡ Note: This is an ADHD project! Ideas come fast, code evolves through trial and error, and fun is a priority.
